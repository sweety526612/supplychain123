It is open-source on the GitHub, deveopers use it for application purpose.
## Solution

Consolidate digital paperwork and item status tracking into a single system, yet save data in a secure, unchangeable decentralised ledger. Provide visibility at all times regarding item information, inventory, cargo status, owner, route, all digital papers and certifications, GPS location, refer temperature. Any device, at any moment, has access to all information. Create an access and rights management system that allows you to govern who has read and write access to which sections of the stored data. By computing document checksums on the fly and comparing them to stored data, you can ensure the integrity and validity of your papers.

#### For item owners:

* streamlines paperwork, allowing for quick provision of documentation and certifications even while the item is already on its way to its destination 
* allows for tracking of the item's location and status

#### For customs authorities:

* streamlines access to item inventory/load information, as well as any relevant paperwork and certificates 
* simplifies access to owner information and direct contact if necessary

#### For port authorities and freight forwarders:

* offers access to item route information with optional alerting capability in case of temperature value rises or power failures 
* gives access to temperature sensor information with optional alerting functionality in case of temperature value rises or power outages

### How it works

The Demo software is based on an open-sourced IOTA library written in JavaScript.


This library exposes functions for creating a new MAM channel, submitting a new event to the existing channel and retrieving data from the channel.
